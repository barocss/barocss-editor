# Archived Documentation

This directory contains planning, spec, and analysis documents that were created during development but may not reflect the current implementation.

## Contents

### Planning Documents
- `drop-behavior-implementation-plan.md` - Initial implementation plan
- `drop-behavior-implementation-options.md` - Analysis of implementation options
- `editable-node-api-proposal.md` - API proposal document

### Analysis Documents
- `block-text-editing-strategies.md` - Analysis of editing strategies
- `replaceText-considerations.md` - Considerations for replaceText
- `replaceText-mark-transformation.md` - Mark transformation analysis

## Note

**Important**: These documents are archived because they represent planning/analysis phases rather than final implementation decisions.

**For design decisions and architecture**, see:
- [Drop Behavior Architecture](../drop-behavior-architecture.md) - Final design decision (hybrid approach)
- [Drop Behavior Spec](../drop-behavior-spec.md) - Implementation specification

**For current implementation**, refer to:
- [DataStore README](../README.md)
- [Transaction Integration Guide](../transaction-integration.md)
- [Document Iterator Specification](../document-iterator-spec.md)
- [Model Traversal API](../model-traversal-api.md)

These archived documents may contain valuable historical context and design decisions. They are preserved here for reference but may not match the current implementation.
