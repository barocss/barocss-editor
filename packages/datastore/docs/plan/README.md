## Note

These planning documents represent the design exploration and analysis phases during development. They may contain valuable historical context and design decisions, but may not reflect the final implementation.

**For final design decisions and architecture**, see:
- [Drop Behavior Architecture](../drop-behavior-architecture.md) - Final design decision (hybrid approach)
- [Drop Behavior Spec](../drop-behavior-spec.md) - Implementation specification

**For current implementation**, refer to:
- [DataStore README](../README.md)
- [Transaction Integration Guide](../transaction-integration.md)
- [Document Iterator Specification](../document-iterator-spec.md)
- [Model Traversal API](../model-traversal-api.md)
