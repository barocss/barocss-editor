# Backlog

What is worth doing next, and why. Kept in the repository rather than in a
conversation, because a list that lives in a conversation is a list that is
forgotten between them.

## How this is kept

- **One entry, one thing a reader could notice.** "The ruler scrolls away" is an
  entry; "refactor the ruler" is not.
- **Say what is already there.** Most of what has been done in this repository
  was not building a feature but *reading* one the schema already had — five
  times over. An entry that names the code that already exists is an entry
  somebody can finish in an afternoon; one that does not is a research task
  wearing a feature's clothes.
- **Move it to Done when it ships, with the surprise it produced.** The surprises
  are the part worth keeping: they are what the next person would otherwise
  rediscover.
- **Add to it while working.** Anything found and not fixed goes in Open before
  the commit that found it.

Find what the schema declares and nothing reads — the sweep that keeps producing
these — from `packages/office-word`:

```
pull the keys out of each *FormatAttrs() group in src/formatting.ts,
strip comments from every other file in src/, and grep
```

Stripping the comments matters: prose mentioning an attribute makes it look
read. Two blind spots stay — a name read for a *different* meaning counts as
read, and a key built by template counts as unread.

## Open

### Shell and navigation

- [ ] **Nothing toggles the panes from the ribbon.** The outline has its own
  close button and the comments pane has none; a View group would be the place
  for both, next to whatever else turns chrome on and off.
- [ ] **No zoom.** Word has a zoom control and a page-width fit; the ruler
  already works in fractions of the page rather than in pixels, so it would
  follow one for free.

### Attributes the schema declares and nothing reads

Each of these is in `src/formatting.ts` with a comment saying what it is for.

- [ ] **`kerning`** — Word stores a minimum font size at which kerning applies;
  CSS has `font-kerning: normal | none`, so the pair is expressible as a
  comparison against the run's size.
- [ ] **`outline`** (character) — outlined text. `-webkit-text-stroke`, or the
  text-shadow approximation the neighbouring `outlineText` mark already uses.
- [ ] **`mirrorIndents`** — left and right indents swap on facing pages. Needs
  the layout to know which side a page is on, which `titlePage` and
  `differentOddEven` already ask.
- [ ] **`suppressAutoHyphens`** — worth nothing until there is hyphenation to
  suppress. Check whether anything hyphenates before taking this one.
- [ ] **`fitText`** (cell) — deliberate: a measurement rather than a format.

### Known and unfixed

- [ ] **Outdenting a top-level list item lifts it out of the list.** The parent's
  parent of a top-level item is the document, and the engine has no rule against
  it — `indentParentTypes` constrains what a node may nest *under* and has no
  counterpart for lifting one out. Recorded in
  `packages/model/test/operations/indentable-schema.exec.test.ts`. A product has
  to ask for the constraint before it is worth adding.
- [ ] **No `.docx` importer.** The converter reads HTML, Markdown, LaTeX and
  writes PDF. Everything the schema knows about Word arrives only from
  `sample-document.ts`, which is why "the schema declares it and nothing reads
  it" keeps being the shape of the work.

## Done

Newest first. The surprise each one produced is the part worth keeping.

- **The comments pane collapses.** It read the threads only while open, which
  was free and wrong the moment it could be closed on purpose — the strip that
  opens it says how many there are, and that is what a reader wants *before*
  deciding to look. Reading them either way also means the commented text stays
  marked while the pane is shut: closing it should put the discussion away, not
  hide the fact that there is one.
- **The shell, and the outline pane.** The window is the frame now — the chrome
  holds its place and the document scrolls in a pane of its own. Two things came
  out of it: the ruler had to learn to re-measure when that pane scrolls
  *sideways*, because a page wider than its pane moves under a ruler that does
  not; and a test that slept 800ms for a smooth scroll of seven thousand pixels
  was guessing at a number it should have been waiting for. The outline itself
  needed no new reading of the document — `tocEntries` already answered it,
  which is why a line there and a line in the contents agree by construction.

- **Tab leaders, and the paragraphs a contents list leaves out.** A menu on the
  ruler is drawn *inside* it, so every click in the menu was also a click on the
  ruler — a dot leader made a stop with no leader. And the dismiss-on-click-away
  listener runs at the capture phase, so it closed the menu ahead of the click it
  was meant to allow.
- **The ruler.** Three faults, all in the browser half: the margins are the
  *section's* padding and not the sheet's (a sheet is paper, drawn behind the
  text, and carries none); writing on every pointer move made one drag ten
  entries of the document's history and ended wherever the last processed move
  was; and taking hold of a stop and letting go is both how Word cycles its
  alignment and how a drag begins.
- **Tab and Ctrl+M.** Ctrl+M was bound to `indentNode`, which needs a schema to
  mark a node `indentable`, and none does — Word's own indent shortcut, dead.
- **One font per run.** Reading Word's three font slots was tried and reverted:
  CSS chooses by *coverage* where Word chooses by *script*, and a near-miss of a
  rule is harder to reason about than one font.
- **The operations a reader could not undo.** Fourteen roster exemptions saying
  "declares no inverse" about an operation that had since been given one. Ctrl+X
  and Ctrl+V were undone by nothing at all. `batch` is the primitive the nine
  that change more than one place were missing.
- **Reading a range that crosses two runs.** It came back empty — the iterator
  began at the document's root, and `getRootNodeId()` is undefined until one is
  registered, so the walk started at `undefined` and stopped before its first
  step. Five operations took that as "there is nothing here" and reported
  success.
- **A paragraph the text wraps around, when it will not fit.** Three separate
  faults, and the line heights were the subtle one: ink scaled up to the block's
  height is right for text and wrong for anything measured as a box, so the
  picture's band was drawn 98px and reported as 117.
